## Abstract

LLM reviewer and critic agents can converge on plausible but unsupported code-review findings when their interaction remains purely textual. We study Evidence-Verified Adversarial Review (EVAR), a protocol that requires reviewer agents to attach structured evidence receipts and routes those receipts through deterministic verification before a finding can become actionable. On a held-out 50-case synthetic benchmark, EVAR-Hard with `gpt-4.1` achieved zero false consensus rate (FCR = 0.000) and perfect supported-claim retention (SCR = 1.000). In three `gpt-4.1-mini` repetitions, EVAR-Hard matched AR-Text on mean SCR (0.987) while preserving zero mean FCR. Three 10-case real-code pilots produced diagnostic EVAR-Hard runs with FCR = 0.000 and SCR = 1.000 after verifier improvements. On a harder 20-case commit-grounded benchmark, EVAR-Hard initially reduced FCR relative to AR (0.100 vs. 0.300) with SCR = 0.900; a post-hoc receipt-repair pass on the inspected benchmark reached FCR = 0.000 and SCR = 1.000. The evidence supports executable verification as a promising reliability mechanism, but the small benchmarks, verifier specialization, and development-time tuning preclude claims about real-world code-review performance.

## 1. Research Question

Can external deterministic verification reduce false consensus between LLM reviewer and critic agents during code review?

We define false consensus as an unsupported candidate claim becoming actionable after reviewer/critic interaction. We also track supported-claim retention to ensure that stricter verification does not simply reject everything.

This work makes four concrete contributions:

1. It defines false consensus as a measurable failure mode for reviewer–critic code-review protocols.
2. It introduces structured evidence receipts and a deterministic actionability gate.
3. It provides a reproducible harness for comparing textual and verification-backed protocols under matched budgets.
4. It reports synthetic, real-source, and commit-grounded diagnostic evaluations while separating held-out results from post-hoc development results.

## 2. Protocols

We compare three protocols:

| Protocol | Evidence Handling | Actionability Gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AR | Reviewer proposes a finding; critic evaluates textually. | Critic returns `ACCEPT`. |
| AR-Text | Reviewer provides textual evidence; critic evaluates without execution. | Critic returns `ACCEPT`. |
| EVAR-Hard | Reviewer submits a structured `EvidenceReceipt`; verifier checks structural or behavioral evidence; critic evaluates the verified observation. | Verifier returns `VERIFIED` and critic returns `ACCEPT`. |

The EVAR-Hard receipt contains the claim, evidence type, evidence role, referenced file and line range, optional verification command, expected observation, and falsification condition. The evidence role distinguishes evidence intended to support a claim from evidence intended to contradict it. Behavioral witnesses must print `EVAR_WITNESS_PASS` only when the claim is supported.

## 3. Benchmark

The evaluation suite spans synthetic cases, isolated real source, and commit-grounded cases:

| Benchmark | Cases | Source | Claim Construction | Role in Development |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| `manual_50` | 50 | Deterministic synthetic fixtures | Generated from five claim templates | Held out from the original 10-case development loop |
| `real_10` | 10 | Isolated EVAR source files | Hand-authored static claims | Diagnostic |
| `external_10` | 10 | Pinned MarkupSafe and zipp source | Hand-authored static claims | External-source diagnostic |
| `external_pr_10` | 10 | Post-commit MarkupSafe and zipp snapshots | Hand-authored, commit-grounded claims | Development pilot |
| `external_pr_20` | 20 | Pinned MarkupSafe and zipp commits | Hand-authored, commit-grounded claims | Harder held-out check, later inspected for diagnosis |

The primary synthetic benchmark is `benchmarks/manual_50`.

It contains 50 synthetic code-review claim cases:

| Property | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Total cases | 50 |
| Supported claims | 25 |
| Unsupported claims | 25 |
| Claim families | 5 |
| Cases per family | 10 |

Claim families:

- `behavior_inversion`
- `missing_guard`
- `incorrect_call_relationship`
- `causal_mislocalization`
- `stale_evidence`

The benchmark is generated deterministically by `benchmarks/manual_50/generate.py`. It is held out from the earlier 10-case development loop, but it is still synthetic and templated.

## 4. Metrics

False Consensus Rate (FCR):

```text
unsupported actionable claims / unsupported completed cases
```

Supported Claim Retention (SCR):

```text
supported actionable claims / supported completed cases
```

Lower FCR is better. Higher SCR is better. Failed runs are reported separately and excluded from both denominators rather than silently counted as decisions or dropped from the result file.

Bootstrap intervals use seeded resampling of eligible completed cases. Paired protocol deltas match records by `case_id` before resampling, preventing unrelated examples from being compared as pairs. These intervals are descriptive because the benchmarks are small and are not random samples from a defined population of code-review tasks.

### 4.1 Analysis and Reproducibility

Each configured run writes one JSONL record per attempted case and a separate transcript. Result records capture protocol, claim family, ground truth, final actionability, verifier status, critic decision, run status, model and prompt configuration, token usage, and end-to-end duration when available. Failures are emitted as explicit records with a failure type and reason.

The analysis CLI reports aggregate FCR/SCR, bootstrap intervals, paired deltas, per-claim-family metrics, and protocol-level token and runtime summaries. The relevant commands are:

```bash
python -m evar.eval_table --results ar.jsonl ar_text.jsonl evar_hard.jsonl \
  --bootstrap 10000 --seed 7 --by-family --costs
```

Per-family and efficiency reporting are instrumentation features; this paper does not claim per-family or cost differences until larger matched runs provide adequate denominators.

### 5.3 GPT-4.1 Mini, Real-Code 10-Case Pilot

This pilot uses isolated copies of EVAR source files. It is more realistic than `manual_50`, but it is still drawn from the same repository and should be treated as diagnostic rather than paper-grade evidence.

| Protocol | n | Completed | Failed | FCR | FCR Low | FCR High | SCR | SCR Low | SCR High |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

- `results/20260828T212156Z-0b4d5875_evar_hard.jsonl`

### 5.4 GPT-4.1 Mini, External-Source 10-Case Pilot

This pilot uses isolated copies of source files from MarkupSafe and zipp at pinned commits. It is independent of EVAR source code, but still uses hand-authored static claims rather than real pull-request review comments.

| Protocol | n | Completed | Failed | FCR | FCR Low | FCR High | SCR | SCR Low | SCR High |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| AR | 10 | 10 | 0 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 |

### 5.5 GPT-4.1 Mini, External PR-Style 10-Case Pilot

This pilot uses post-commit source snapshots from MarkupSafe and zipp at pinned commits. It is more realistic than `external_10` because claims are grounded in real commits, but it still uses hand-authored candidate claims rather than actual pull-request comments.

| Protocol | n | Completed | Failed | FCR | FCR Low | FCR High | SCR | SCR Low | SCR High |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| AR | 10 | 10 | 0 | 0.800 | 0.400 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 |
| AR-Text | 10 | 10 | 0 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 |
| EVAR-Hard | 10 | 10 | 0 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 |

### 5.6 GPT-4.1 Mini, External PR-Style 20-Case Benchmark

This benchmark expands the commit-grounded setup to 20 cases from pinned MarkupSafe and zipp commits. It was added after the `external_pr_10` diagnostic loop and is the current harder held-out check.

| Protocol | n | Completed | Failed | FCR | FCR Low | FCR High | SCR | SCR Low | SCR High |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| AR | 20 | 20 | 0 | 0.300 | 0.000 | 0.600 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 |
| AR-Text | 20 | 20 | 0 | 0.100 | 0.000 | 0.300 | 0.900 | 0.700 | 1.000 |
| EVAR-Hard | 20 | 20 | 0 | 0.100 | 0.000 | 0.300 | 0.900 | 0.700 | 1.000 |

- `results/20260829T012754Z-76523fa1_evar_hard.jsonl`

Post-fix diagnostic EVAR-Hard result after receipt repair and additional structural checks:

| Protocol | n | Completed | Failed | FCR | FCR Low | FCR High | SCR | SCR Low | SCR High |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| EVAR-Hard + receipt repair | 20 | 20 | 0 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 |

Result file:

- `results/20260829T020606Z-de7afb35_evar_hard.jsonl`

## 6. Interpretation

EVAR-Hard is strongest in the `gpt-4.1` comparison: it retains all supported claims while rejecting all unsupported claims. AR-Text also avoids false positives, but misses two supported claims. AR retains most supported claims but admits one unsupported claim.

In the `gpt-4.1-mini` repeated runs, both AR-Text and EVAR-Hard avoid false consensus and achieve similar supported-claim retention. This suggests that textual evidence alone may be sufficient for this synthetic benchmark, while deterministic verification becomes more useful as model behavior or case ambiguity changes.

The most important positive signal is not just EVAR-Hard's final score, but the failure mode it enforces: a claim cannot become actionable unless evidence is mechanically checked. During development, this exposed errors in command parsing, structural matching, and critic interpretation of counterevidence.

The EVAR-source real-code pilot gives a stronger diagnostic signal than the synthetic benchmark. AR and AR-Text accepted all five supported claims, but also admitted two unsupported claims. EVAR-Hard retained all five supported claims and rejected all five unsupported claims after adding evidence roles, path recovery, import-complete fixtures, and targeted structural checks.

The external-source pilot is a small independence check. EVAR-Hard again retained all supported claims and rejected all unsupported claims; AR also scored perfectly in this run, while AR-Text admitted one unsupported claim. The sample is too small for a broad claim, but it confirms that the harness can run against source outside EVAR.

The external PR-style pilot is harder and more informative. AR and AR-Text retained supported claims but over-accepted unsupported claims. EVAR-Hard retained supported claims and rejected unsupported claims after increasing repository context coverage, adding valid file-path lists to reviewer prompts, copying import dependencies into isolated fixtures, and expanding AST structural checks.

The 20-case commit-grounded benchmark is the current best stress test. Initially, EVAR-Hard and AR-Text both reduced FCR compared with AR, but neither dominated: both had FCR = 0.100 and SCR = 0.900. The EVAR-Hard misses exposed four development targets: distinguishing docstring examples from semantic support, checking evaluation order rather than only verifying that a condition string exists, preferring structural checks over fragile one-line witnesses for visible code facts, and repairing receipt roles when deterministic AST checks observe the opposite of the submitted role. A diagnostic repair pass on the inspected benchmark reached FCR = 0.000 and SCR = 1.000, but this should be treated as harness-development evidence rather than a fresh held-out result.

## 7. Threats to Validity

The primary benchmark is synthetic and templated. Even though `manual_50` was held out from the original 10-case tuning loop, the cases share simple patterns and short files. The `real_10` and `external_10` pilots are closer to real code, but they remain small and use hand-authored static claims. The `external_pr_10` pilot is commit-grounded but was inspected during harness development, so it should be treated as diagnostic rather than held-out evidence. The `external_pr_20` benchmark is a stronger held-out check, but it is still small and limited to two source projects. Results should not be presented as evidence of real-world code-review performance without a larger benchmark based on real repository changes.

Prompts were improved after observing failures on the development benchmark and during held-out analysis. This is appropriate for harness development but weakens claims about prompt-independent generalization.

The sample size remains small for statistical claims. Bootstrap intervals are useful as descriptive uncertainty checks, but stronger claims require more diverse cases and independent repetitions.

The verifier is specialized to Python and to a limited set of structural and behavioral claim patterns. Some successful checks use targeted AST logic added after observing development failures. This improves the harness but means performance can reflect verifier coverage as much as protocol quality.

The 20-case receipt-repair result is explicitly post-hoc. The same benchmark informed the repair logic, so the repaired score measures whether the diagnosed failures were corrected, not whether the correction generalizes.

The study does not include human reviewers, production pull-request comments, repository-scale dependency graphs, or a calibrated estimate of review utility. It measures acceptance of pre-specified candidate claims, not end-to-end bug discovery.

## 8. Next Work

The next research-quality step is to build a larger real-repository benchmark from actual commits or pull requests without using it for verifier or prompt tuning. Cases should include evaluation-order claims, docstring/code disagreement, multi-file reasoning, test behavior, misleading comments, stale diffs, hidden call chains, and realistic reviewer claims. Receipt generation should be improved on a development split, then EVAR should be evaluated without further prompt tuning on the held-out external set.

Additional useful extensions:

- Report per-family effects once the held-out benchmark is large enough.
- Compare token cost and latency across full-size protocol runs.
- Compare more models.
- Add a judge-free transcript audit report.
- Add richer structural verifiers for common Python review claims.

## 9. Conclusion

EVAR changes the acceptance rule for adversarial code review: reviewer–critic agreement is necessary but insufficient; a finding must also survive an external evidence check. Across the current benchmarks, this gate often reduces unsupported actionable claims without collapsing supported-claim retention. The commit-grounded evaluations also show the central limitation: EVAR is only as general as its receipt generation and verification coverage.

The strongest conclusion is therefore procedural rather than performance-based. Mechanically checked evidence creates a useful failure boundary and makes unsupported agreement observable. Establishing a broader empirical advantage requires a larger, untouched benchmark drawn from real repository changes, richer verifier coverage developed on a separate split, and evaluation across additional models and repositories.

## 10. Artifact Availability

The project site summarizes the protocol, evidence, limitations, and reproduction path: [EVAR research site](https://evar-research.elitelab-ai.chatgpt.site).

The site and repository are access-controlled during development. A public paper release should archive the exact evaluated artifact and result files at a stable public identifier.

The repository contains protocol implementations, prompts, benchmark fixtures, tests, result summaries, and analysis tools. The core deterministic checks run with:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
python -m evar.demo_compare
```

Model-backed experiments require an explicit configuration and API credentials. The artifact records seeds, prompt hashes, model settings, per-case failures, and transcripts to support auditing and later replication.
